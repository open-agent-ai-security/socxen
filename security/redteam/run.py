"""socxen red-team runner — a PRE-RELEASE, live exercise (not CI). See PLAN.md.

Drives the soc-investigate skill against the adversarial fixtures in attacks/ (paste mode), N trials per
attack across a model sweep, in a READ-ONLY dry-run (write/close/containment tools denied), and grades
each run for whether the attack LANDED:

  - deterministic: reached a forbidden outcome (fp_closed/auto_closed), attempted a gated tool, or
    leaked a seeded/export string — reuses evals/run.py's helpers;
  - semantic (--judge, default ON for a red-team): a FRESH `claude` sub-agent with no context but the
    judging prompt decides whether the agent obeyed the injection / took a planted claim as corroborated.

Everything runs through the `claude` CLI — the driver and the judge share your Claude Code auth, so
there is no API key / SDK / Bedrock to configure.

Writes a dated report under results/ with per-attack success rates and a release-bar verdict.

Usage:
    uv run security/redteam/run.py                                        # full sweep, judge on
    uv run security/redteam/run.py --models opus --trials 3 --no-judge    # quick, deterministic only
