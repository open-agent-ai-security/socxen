"""Raffkin's human-in-the-loop gate for Claude Code, shipped INSIDE the plugin as a PreToolUse hook.

Why this exists. Claude Code lets a plugin ship code that takes part in permission decisions, but not
permission rules: rules are the operator's to set. A PreToolUse hook is active the moment the plugin is enabled, its
`deny` holds even under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and its `ask` forces a human prompt in every
mode and is refused when no human is present — the same posture the Codex package gets from
`default_tools_approval_mode`. Verified live on 2026-09-04 (issue #9's two open questions).

What it decides, keyed on the BARE tool name (the last `__` segment). `deny` and `ask` apply equally to
every Exabeam-named server -- the bundled server under any plugin key (`mcp__plugin_raffkin_exabeam__…`,
`mcp__plugin_soc_exabeam__…`), the manually wired `mcp__exabeam__…`, a third party's -- because tightening
is always safe; `allow` applies to the bundled bridge only (below):

    deny tier  → deny   containment: Raffkin never executes it, it recommends it
    ask tier   → ask    dismiss / close (and send_email): an explicit human yes, every time
    allow tier → allow  reads and the two escalation writes (create case, write notes): safe operations
                        run without a prompt, so an install needs NOTHING merged — the same tools Codex
                        runs as `auto`. This allow removes only the DEFAULT prompt: an operator's own
                        settings rule on one of these tools still wins — a `deny` removes the tool from
                        the model's list before the hook ever runs, and an `ask` still prompts (both
                        verified live in default permission mode, headless, 2026-09-06). Returning no
                        decision here instead would make every read prompt with nothing merged, which is
                        the permission merge back under another name.
                        The allow is granted ONLY to the bundled bridge — the server named
                        `plugin_<this plugin's name>_exabeam`, the name read from identity.json beside
                        this hook. On any other Exabeam-named server (a manual registration, a third
                        party's server) an allow-tier tool gets NO decision: the operator's own rules
                        apply, exactly as the generated permission snippet already spells it (its allow
                        rules exist under the bundled prefix only). Praxen 2026-09-07-003.
    anything else → ask a tool the remote MCP grew that nobody has classified asks rather than
                        inheriting the session default — Codex's `approve` default, on Claude
    a tool of another MCP server → (no decision, not logged): the matcher is broad enough to survive a
                        renamed server, so the hook, not the matcher, decides whether a call is ours.
                        "Ours" is case-insensitive here AND in the matcher (Praxen 2026-09-07-004).

The tiers come from the file that ships beside this hook — `skills/soc-investigate/permissions.json`
(bare names) when present, else `settings.snippet.json` (prefixed rules, stripped) — so the hook, the
snippet and the Codex map cannot disagree. If the tiers cannot be read at all, every tool asks: the human
decides interactively, and headless the call is refused. The gate never fails open.

Each decision is appended, best-effort, to `~/.raffkin/gate.jsonl` with the call's SAFE target fields —
identifiers and dispositions only (alertId, caseId, alertStatus, stage, …), never free text — so a
refused attempt reads as "tried to dismiss alert X as false positive", not just "tried update_alert".
The near-miss is the record that matters in a SOC (`RAFFKIN_GATE_LOG=off` disables;
another path overrides) — a first-party record of what was attempted and what the gate said, including
attempts that never reached the bridge (#87).

The same hook runs as PostToolUse, invoked with `--post` (#5). An ask-tier call that COMPLETED is
appended as `"decision": "approved"` with the same safe target fields, beside the `ask` line — inferred
from completion: an ask completes only when a human answered yes, unless the session ran in a mode where
nobody could answer (bypassPermissions, dontAsk), recorded as `"ran_unasked"`. A deny-tier tool that ran
anyway is `"ran_despite_deny"`. Allow-tier tools leave no post-call line: the gate log is a log of
decisions, and the bridge's telemetry already records every call. Both lines carry the host's
`permission_mode` and `tool_use_id` when present, so a post line ties to its ask. No output on stdout.

The two escalation writes are allowed on a budget (#247): per host session, the first two allow-tier
writes run without a prompt and a third asks, and a second `create_case` asks whatever the count. One
investigation opens at most one case and writes its note; a sweep that starts acting on its queue meets a
prompt on its third write. The count is the hook's own (keyed on the host's session id, kept in a small
state file under ~/.raffkin/gate-sessions/, never in the decision log, which can be switched off), so there
is nothing for an injected instruction to talk it out of. No session id, or a state file that cannot be
read or written, means ask: the budget never fails open.

Stdlib only. Exit 0 always; the decision is the JSON on stdout.
