"""Exabeam MCP bridge.

A tiny local (stdio) MCP server that Claude Code launches and talks to, which forwards
every request to the *remote* Exabeam New-Scale MCP — minting and refreshing the OAuth
token automatically so the human never deals with expiring tokens.

Connect once:
    claude mcp add exabeam -- uv run /path/to/exabeam-mcp-bridge.py

Reads creds from ~/.exabeam-mcp.env:
    EXABEAM_MCP_URL=https://api.<region>.exabeam.cloud/mcp
    EXABEAM_API_KEY=...
    EXABEAM_API_SECRET=...

Run with --check to validate the connection (and warm the dependency cache) without
starting the server.

#     agent reasons over telemetry (connector/canonicalize.py).
#   • OUTPUT neutralization on WRITE ARGUMENTS — defang active content (formulas/phishing links) in what
#     socxen persists to Exabeam, so an export of that stored artifact can't fire (connector/
#     neutralize_output.py — the a10 fix). Only the write tools; reads are never argument-mutated.
# Both are FAIL-OPEN: a guardrail bug must never break an investigation.
