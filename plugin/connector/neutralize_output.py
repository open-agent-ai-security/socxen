"""Output-side active-content neutralizer -- the a10 (export / formula injection) fix.

Applied to content socxen WRITES back through the bridge (case notes, alert/case updates) so a payload
planted in telemetry cannot fire when that persisted artifact is later exported. Scope is deliberately
narrow -- "do no harm; stop the obvious; document the exotic" -- to two ACTIVE-content forms:

  1. FORMULA cells (=HYPERLINK(...), @SUM(...), =cmd|'..'!A0): quote-prefixed inert, and any URL on the
     formula's line is defanged. Stops CSV / formula injection on spreadsheet export.
  2. LINKS -- markdown in every CommonMark/GFM form (inline [text](target) with or without a title or
     padding, reference definitions [ref]: target, autolinks <target>) and HTML (href/src/action/...
     attributes, srcset, CSS url() in style attributes and <style> blocks): the target is defanged
     (host -> [.], scheme -> hxxp, javascript: -> [:]) UNLESS it points into the operator's own tenant.
     "Clickable is decided by destination, not authorship" (#147): the model writes the text, so
     "socxen wrote this link" carries no trust; a URL to the operator's own console is verifiable
     against config, anything else is not. The allowlist is derived from EXABEAM_MCP_URL by the bridge
     (tenant_hosts_from_url) -- never curated, never model-influenced -- and defaults to EMPTY, so with
     no config every link is defanged (the safe default the red-team harness grades under).
  2b. ACTIVE HTML that is never a link anyone wants: script/iframe/object/embed/svg/math elements are
     removed, form/meta/base/link tags are made inert, on*= event handlers are dropped, and in a MAIL
     body (mail=True) even a bare URL in text is defanged because mail clients auto-link it. The mail
     template's inline styles, bgcolor and entities pass through untouched (do-no-harm corpus in tests).
  3. SECRETS / STRUCTURED PII (the class-D redaction fix, #88 / assessment F-04): a credential or
     structured government identifier planted in telemetry must not survive verbatim into a persisted
     case note / export -- a durable, broader-audience artifact. Prompt-only redaction was measured
     leaking 100% (red-team d01/d03), so this is deterministic. Each match is replaced with a typed
     placeholder [REDACTED:<kind>] so the report still says "a credential was here" without the value.

  neutralize_output(text) -> (clean_text, notes)     # notes: list of {"type","original"} that changed

DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS (out of scope, by decision):
  - a BARE URL typed in prose (not a markdown link, not on a formula line) is left UNTOUCHED -- defanging
    every URL would mangle the legit reference links analysts write in notes (do harm).
  - an OPEN REDIRECT on the tenant host would pass the allowlist. That is the same trust already
    extended to the console itself; chasing it means URL-path analysis and is not worth it (#147).
  - HTML is neutralized by a tag-and-attribute pass, not a full parser: a '>' inside a quoted attribute
    value is handled, but malformed markup that a lenient renderer "fixes" into something different
    (unclosed quotes spanning tags) is escaped conservatively rather than reasoned about.
  - an ALL-ALPHABETIC value after a BARE LINE BREAK ("Recovered credential\ncorrecthorsebatterystaple")
    is not caught: after a line break, a word with no digit and no delimiter is indistinguishable from
    recommendation prose ("credential\nRotation is required immediately"), and redacting it would eat
    real analyst text. Labeled (`password: X`), wrapped (`X` / "X"), and markdown-TABLE forms are all
    caught regardless of shape -- this residual is only the bare-newline-plus-dictionary-word case.
  - FREE-FORM PII (names, home addresses) and DATE-shaped values (DOB) are NOT redacted: a home address
    is not reliably regex-detectable, and a date is indistinguishable from the timestamp on every log
    line (redacting it would gut legitimate reports). These stay a best-effort SKILL-prompt ask.
  - the operator's own on-screen chat is not a sink here: they are authorized to read the raw telemetry,
    so display crosses no trust boundary. This gates the WRITE path (what gets persisted), not the console.

Redaction is HIGH-SPECIFICITY only -- format/prefix/checksum/label-anchored, never blind entropy -- so a
hash, UUID, IP, or hostname in a legitimate report passes through untouched (see the FP corpus in tests).
