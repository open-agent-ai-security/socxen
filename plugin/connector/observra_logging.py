"""Structured, durable agent telemetry for the Exabeam MCP bridge — ON by default, for assurance.

Built on **observra** (https://open-agent-ai-security.github.io/observra/), an agent-telemetry SDK.

Why here: the bridge sits in the path of *every* tool call the `soc-investigate` agent makes, so it is
the natural place to record what the agent did — which Exabeam tools it called, how long they took,
whether they succeeded, **the gated action it took** (which alert/case, to what disposition), and, uniquely
useful for this project, **when the two deterministic guardrails actually fired** (input canonicalization
stripping a smuggling code point; output neutralization defanging a formula / phishing link before a
write). That turns the log into a machine-parseable audit trail — the thing a production SOC needs to
reconstruct a session or drive anomaly detection, in place of the free-form markdown report alone.

DEFAULT ON. A good agent keeps an audit trail. Logging runs unless you explicitly turn it off
(`RAFFKIN_OBSERVRA=off`). The default backend is a local, rotating JSON-lines file — no network egress.

Not an exact framework fit, by design: observra's `create_plugin()` hooks a supported *framework* (ADK,
Claude SDK, LangChain, ...). Our "agent" is Claude Code driving a skill over an MCP bridge — there is no
such framework object. Since observra 1.1 that's a first-class case: this shim emits through the public
`observra.emit()` (framework-agnostic instrumentation), and rotation bounds pass straight through
`initialize()` to the jsonl backend. The one remaining private touch is the exit drain
(`_worker._shutdown()`) — a public `shutdown()` is requested upstream (observra#117). Requires
observra >= 1.1 (the bridge's PEP 723 header pins `observra>=1.1,<2`).

DESIGN RULES:
  * FAIL-OPEN, ALWAYS. Telemetry is best-effort and must NEVER break or slow an investigation. A
    CONFIGURATION error (observra missing, backend misconfigured) disables logging and is swallowed; a
    single failed emit drops only THAT event and leaves the trail on — a transient fault must not switch
    off a mandatory audit log for the rest of the session.
  * PRIVACY BY CONSTRUCTION. We log *metadata* about the agent's actions — tool names, durations, gated-
    action IDs/enums (alertId, alertStatus, disposition, ...), guardrail counts, stripped code-point
    classes — never the free-text field values / notes / payloads the guardrails neutralize. The audit
    log records *what was decided*, not the raw evidence. (observra also applies its own PII redaction.)
  * BOUNDED. The jsonl backend rotates (default 10 MB × 5 backups ≈ 60 MB ceiling) so it never grows
    without limit.

Configuration (all optional):
    RAFFKIN_OBSERVRA=jsonl              # default; also: off | exabeam | otel | otel_log | webhook
    RAFFKIN_OBSERVRA_PATH=~/.raffkin/telemetry.jsonl     # jsonl backend location (default)
    RAFFKIN_OBSERVRA_MAX_BYTES=10485760                 # rotate at this size (default 10 MB)
    RAFFKIN_OBSERVRA_BACKUPS=5                          # keep this many rotated files (default 5)

The `exabeam` backend routes telemetry back into Exabeam using the bridge's own creds — on-brand, but it
makes network calls, so it is never the default; `jsonl` (local, offline, rotating) is.
