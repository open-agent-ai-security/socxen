# Investigation report template

Produce this at the end of every investigation. It is the audit trail — keep it evidence-backed and
skimmable. Write the same content into the case via `exabeam_create_case_notes` once a case exists.

```markdown
# Investigation: <alert/case title> (<ID>)

**Verdict:** Confirmed threat | False positive | Inconclusive (escalated)
**Confidence:** High | Medium | Low
**Primary entity:** <user / host / IP>
**MITRE ATT&CK:** <Txxxx technique(s)>
**Analyst action taken:** <case opened / alert dismissed / case updated + notes>

## What fired
<One or two plain sentences: what rule/model triggered, on what entity, when, and why.>

## Timeline
| Time (UTC) | Event | Source (tool / alert ID) |
|---|---|---|
| … | … | … |

## Evidence
- <Finding> — <what it shows> — *(source: tool/alert ID)*
- …
> Every bullet cites where it came from. No source → it doesn't belong here.

## Assessment
**Malicious hypothesis:** <statement> — supported by / contradicted by …
**Benign hypothesis:** <statement> — supported by / contradicted by …
**Deciding evidence:** <the one or two things that settled it.>

## Verdict & rationale
<2–4 sentences. State the conclusion and why the evidence supports it at the stated confidence.>

## Actions
- Taken: <create_case / update_alert / update_case / case_notes — with IDs>
- **Recommended containment (analyst to approve):**
  - <containment action> on <entity> — <why, and expected blast radius>

## Open questions / next steps (if inconclusive)
- <What's still unknown and exactly what a human should look at next.>

Taxonomy outcome: <raised | auto_closed | fp_closed>
```

## Quality bar
- A reader who never saw the alert can follow your reasoning to the same verdict in 60 seconds.
- Containment is **recommended**, never silently performed.
- "Inconclusive" is an honest, valid outcome — use it instead of forcing a verdict the evidence
  doesn't support.
