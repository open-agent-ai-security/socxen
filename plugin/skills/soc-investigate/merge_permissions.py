"""Merge socxen's governance permissions snippet into a Claude Code settings.json.

This is the write half of the governance gate. `install.sh` has always *detected*
whether the gate is on (`gate_on()`) and warned when it wasn't — but nothing ever
performed the merge, so the shipped default was "gate OFF until the operator hand-edits
~/.claude/settings.json" and the installer was a detection control, not an enforcement
one (#70). This module closes that gap without giving up the consent model: it never
runs unless the operator explicitly asks for it.

Design rules, all of them load-bearing:

* **Additive only.** Snippet entries are appended to their tier. The operator's own
  rules are never removed, reordered, or rewritten. Merging is a union, not a reset.
* **Tier conflicts abort the whole merge.** If a rule the snippet wants in `ask`
  already sits in the operator's `allow` (or vice versa), that is either deliberate
  operator intent or a mis-merge a human should look at — either way, silently
  *moving* it would be us overriding a human decision about a safety control. We stop
  and report every conflict instead, and write nothing.
* **Backup before write, restore on failure.** The target is the operator's real
  settings file; a half-written settings.json breaks Claude Code entirely.
* **Idempotent.** Re-running detects an already-merged gate and changes nothing.
  Callers verify with install.sh's `gate_on()` afterwards rather than trusting our
  exit code.

Note that a merge can be a no-op for the `ask` tier and still have real work to do:
an operator who hand-copied only the two dismiss/close lines has a gate that reads ON
while the 17-entry containment `deny` list is missing. So "gate is on" is not a reason
to skip the merge — only "every snippet entry is already in its tier" is.

Exit codes (install.sh branches on these; deliberately not 0/1 so an unhandled
traceback's exit 1 can never be mistaken for a real answer):

    0   changes applied  (or, with --dry-run, changes are pending)
    10  already merged — nothing to do
    20  tier conflict — operator must resolve; nothing written
    30  error (unreadable/malformed input, write failure) — nothing written
