"""Derive plugin/.mcp.codex.json from the Claude Code permissions snippet.

socxen's human-in-the-loop gate is expressed twice, because the two host agents
enforce it in different places:

  Claude Code  settings.snippet.json -> permissions.allow / ask / deny, merged by the
               operator into settings.json. The gate ships OFF; nothing enforces it
               until someone merges it (PRAX-001).

  Codex        .mcp.codex.json -> the same three tiers as approval modes on the
               plugin-bundled server. Codex reads this straight out of the installed
               plugin, so the gate ships ON — no merge step, no operator action.

Keeping the two by hand would guarantee drift, and drift in this particular pair is a
safety regression rather than a cosmetic one. So the Codex file is generated from the
Claude one and pinned by tests/test_repo_invariants.py.

Tier mapping:

    allow -> approval_mode "auto"      run without asking
    ask   -> approval_mode "approve"   always require a human
    deny  -> disabled_tools            removed from the tool list entirely; Codex
                                       applies disabled_tools after any allowlist, so
                                       these cannot be re-enabled at runtime

`default_tools_approval_mode` is "approve", which is the one place the Codex gate is
deliberately stricter than the Claude one: a tool the remote server grows that nobody
has classified yet asks a human instead of inheriting a default. Fail-safe, not
fail-open — and it's why we do NOT set `enabled_tools`, which would silently drop an
unclassified tool instead of surfacing it.

Run:  python3 scripts/gen_codex_mcp.py        (writes)
      python3 scripts/gen_codex_mcp.py --check (exits 1 if the file is stale)
