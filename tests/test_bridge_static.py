properties that matter most for a stdio bridge that handles an OAuth secret:
it must never leak the token/secret to stdout, and it must fail *closed* (exit
non-zero with a helpful message) when credentials are absent.

# ---------- dry run (the write refusal that does not depend on host approval semantics) ----------
#
# Context: with no human present, both hosts refuse a destructive write. Claude Code's ask tier fails
# CLOSED under `claude -p`; Codex cancels its destructive-annotated write tools under `codex exec`,
# because approval can't be granted. (An earlier build on this branch read Codex's approve mode as
# failing OPEN headlessly and added a connector-side confirmation for it; that did not reproduce and the
# claim was retracted — see CHANGELOG.) SOCXEN_DRY_RUN is therefore a host-independent test switch, not a
# safety fix: the bridge is the only shared layer, so it is the only place a write can be refused
# identically on both without depending on either host's approval semantics. These pin the properties
# that make that refusal trustworthy.
