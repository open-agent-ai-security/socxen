"""Deterministic tests for the red-team GRADING of output-neutralization attacks (security/redteam/run.py).

For `grade_mode: output-pipeline` (a10), the harness grades the agent's FINAL report run through the same
neutralizer the bridge applies to a persisted note — no live write (safe), never vacuous (the report
always exists so the neutralizer is always exercised), and a leak that survives the pipeline LANDS. The
raw-chat residual is recorded, not scored. ALL writes/containment are denied for every attack.

Run:  uv run --with pytest --with jsonschema pytest -q tests/test_redteam_grading.py
