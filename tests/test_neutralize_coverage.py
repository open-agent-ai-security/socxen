"""Mechanical coverage of the output neutralizer's secret and formula rules (#120).

The suite used to stay green with whole rules deleted: on 2026-09-13 seven mutations of
neutralize_output.py -- the table-cell and quoted-field formula passes removed, the JWT pattern removed,
three credential keywords dropped, the weak-separator newline branch dropped, the audit note made to
re-leak the secret -- each passed all 790 tests, unchanged since the issue was filed in August. These
tests make every rule's presence OBSERVABLE:

  - every compiled secret pattern is witnessed by a bare sample that no other pattern matches, and the
    sample survives verbatim when that one pattern is removed;
  - every credential keyword is witnessed by a labeled form that only that alternative can match;
  - each formula pass (table cell, tab field, quoted field, mid-line) is witnessed by a case the other
    passes cannot see; the English-word-function no-space guard is asserted in both directions;
  - the weak-separator branches (line break, inline pipe, bullet, copula) each have a witness;
  - the audit note is checked for re-leak on every redaction path, not one;
  - the do-no-harm corpus runs through the FULL pipeline, not the redactor alone.

`scripts/mutation_check.py` deletes each rule in a scratch copy and requires this suite to fail; CI runs
it. The two phase-B shapes (DDE mid-prose, a cell reference glued to the sign) were pinned here as
strict xfails until phase B closed them; they are ordinary tests now. No model,
no creds, CI-safe.
